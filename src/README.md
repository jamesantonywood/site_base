# Site base

Development of a new site base, I want to implement some of the practices I currently find useful with gulp.js but with more up to date tools.

JavaScript compilation.
Sass & CSS - easy to switch between.
Images and other static assets.
Data & JSON.

Try out Pug for HTML compilation
    - not yet read through the docs but being able to have a layout set up and yeild the body tag (like WP and MVC set ups) would be super beneficial in scratching out templates. (I hope)
